Hi!  I'm Colleen and I'm a data scientist from Ottawa, Canada.  In this blog,
I showcase some of my personal data projects and occasionally post about
whatever random thing (data science related or not) I'm currently obsessing over.  These
topics could include:

1. Neat machine learning algorithms.
2. Pretty graphs
3. Frustrating Python errors.
4. My formerly-obese and totally adorable kitty.
5. Any of the 10 knitting projects I have on the go at a given time.

Yay, blogging.
